Two Degrees Cooler is launching Spotlights, a project highlighting a different environmental issue each month through articles, news, and art on Bluesky and my website.

The climate crisis is the most pressing issue of our time and many of us are compelled to help, but it feels too big, too hopeless, or too specialised. I started Two Degrees Cooler to share scientific information in an accessible way, but it can feel like the work I do is too scattered, jumping around topics without going into enough depth. That's why I'm launching Spotlights. Each month, I’ll tackle one environmental issue in depth and explore it through articles, news, and art on Bluesky and my website. 

February will kick off the project with 'Our Atmosphere', covering the ozone, greenhouse gases, and the main metric discussed when we talk about the climate crisis: carbon dioxide. You can expect deep dives into the science, clear explanations of the latest news, and visuals that bring research to life.

My goal with Two Degrees Cooler has always been primarily to learn, and then to share. In the month I've been on Bluesky I've learnt a lot, shared a lot, and been lucky enough to connect with many inspiring people. I want this project to be a spark that ignites interest in the climate crisis and empowers people with enough information to get started. By having hubs on major subtopics like greenhouse gases, the ocean, fashion pollution, energy consumption, etc. I hope you’ll find a topic that sparks your interest and connects with your unique skills and take a stand with us to save our planet. 

I'm not an expert in the climate crisis but I'm doing what I can and I hope it inspires you to get involved too. I'd love to connect with people interested in climate and environmental science to learn from them and share what we're doing. If that's you, please say hi, I'd love to talk about your work.
